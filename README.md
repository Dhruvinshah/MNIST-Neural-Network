# MNIST-Neural-Network
#### Built a Neurak Network for MNIST data classification
#### Neural Network has 2 hidden layers (with size of 128 and 64 respectively) and an output layer. Sigmoid, Sigmoid derivative and Softmax activation functions are used.
#### Backpropagation technique was used.
#### Achieved an accuracy rate of 95%.
